       <h2>C the 2 seconds of my life</h2>
       <p>On a sunny evening the pearl like shiny clouds and the golden sun was playing hide and seek on the percean blue sky when I saw C .
        C the first attraction I  was affinated with ,C the first lady who taught me what going on means in life and never turning behind the path means on the life ahead I  was to survive.
        
        The golden sun too came out the pearl like shiny cloud when it too saw C and start peeping her never endingly.The golden rays of sun falling on her making a delicate pattern of rareness and masterpiece rushed on falling at her face ,o lord  I  flunted away at the first glance I saw her the black long fluttering hair with an black masknier looking eye brown shining loud  with a rounded  brown pairs of eye shaped as an angel with a white wings ready to fly and make me trave her world .
        The innocent introvert guy was just peeping silently at her from a distance in a losted of dillima  with her smile just killed the silence in his heart the heart heard it and oued him to  go talk to her out but the mind was still introvert hyr it was atal not being able to walk a step forward probably he was still the old angad yes angad the boy who once reached the submit of everest like and fall the rise front of his eyes at a blinky second  and thats about me .
        The seconds I passed peeping her was like an eternal but once passed looking back Felt like the seconds were on a hurry passed to quack.
        o fuck o fuck the peep turned shy when she suddenly turned towards me and the millisecond of the touch of our eye is still the best second I passed as a teen .
        The story ended here for a long .</p>
